# ðŸŽµ Media Session Master

Media Session Master is a chrome extension that utilizes [Chrome's MediaSession API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/media-session) in sites that don't fully support it.

MediaSession API allows you to pause & play media within Chrome's UI and extends to the systems ability to recognize media being played. (You can use the pause & play buttons on your F1-12 keys)

## Installation

The extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store yet, but you are able to download the ZIP of the source code and install it locally.

You can download the development branch [here](https://github.com/Snazzah/MusicSessionMaster/archive/master.zip) or the stable branch [here](https://github.com/Snazzah/MusicSessionMaster/archive/stable.zip).

Once downloaded, in order to load the package:
- **Extract the folder that is inside the ZIP** somewhere special.
- Head to the Extensions page (`Chrome > Settings > Extensions`)
- Flip the `Developer Mode` switch on the top right of the screen.
- Click `Load unpacked` on the top left and select the folder you extracted.
- Appreciate the effort!
